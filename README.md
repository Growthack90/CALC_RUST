# CALC_RUST
This app simulates simple operations of a calculator.

Try to run an operation in your terminal, for example:

```
$ cargo run 2 + 3
```

It will return in output:

```
2 + 3 = 5
```

ALTERNATIVELY:
To run the binary and test your application run the following command:
```
$ target/release/<name_project> arg1 arg2 arg3
(EXAMPLE: $ target/release/calcolatrice-rust 2 + 3)
```
It will return the same in output:

```
2 + 3 = 5
```
